 (BM)   removed most of the PPERLC and AWP stuff that was intended
        to help the port to ActiveState perl.  Use the One True Perl.

 (BM)   Changed many of the allocations to use perl's memory manager,
        except where the structure or element is grown further internally
        by ARS, or where the structure is non-trivial to free().  I still
        have concerns about some of the un-freed allocations in 
        supportrev.c, but at least ALL of the demo scripts, 
        including ARSDoc-1.11 (with small patch submitted to list) now 
        run, and produce the right results.

 (BM)   Removed all references to ZEROMEM in favor of perl's Zero, which
        is guaranteed to work everywhere, and doesn't need additional logic.

 (BM)   fixed a couple of small typos, including one in a elliptical 
        declaration (...) which didn't have a comma separator.

 (BM)   Changed the logic of CVLD in one place that was attempting to free()
        null pointers.

Released: 10/06/97 Version: 1.50


(JCM)   removed ars_errstr from C code. replaced with ars_errhash.
        modified ARS.pm to refer to hash when $ars_errstr is 
        accessed. $ars_errstr no longer tie'd to main:: package.

(JCM)   bug fix (Sid Van den Heede) "affecting getting of
        displayInstanceList"

(JCM)   bug fix (James LewisMoss) for ars_GetCharMenu()

(JCM)   bug fix (Ian Flanigan) for perl_ARIndexStruct()

(JCM)   modified GetListEntry(), GetEntry(), SetEntry() and 
        DeleteEntry() to make operations on join schemas 
        transparent.

(JCM)   added a ARVerifyUser call to ars_Login so that
        ars_Login() || die() will work as one would expect it to.

(JCM)   added $VERSION to the perl module file.

(JCM)   added "log to file" action to GetFilter action hash 
        (requested by {D.J.Adams at soton.ac.uk})

(JCM)   added updated doc tree to main distribution (contributed by
        {D.J.Adams at soton.ac.uk})

(JCM)   new functions and doc on new functions and new examples for some
        of these new functions.

(JCM) ! altered return value of perl_ARStatusStruct so that it 
        returns a hash of the various StatusStruct members so that
        reversing the operation is simpler. scripts that, for example,
        retrieve active link definitions and print them out that previous
        expected the {message} key to point to a string will need to
        be updated.

(JCM)   added valueType to the assign structure to assist in 
        reversing the operation (converting perl to C API assign 
        structure).

(JCM)   added displayTag as an optional parameter to ars_LoadQualifier()
        so that you can build queries against customized views (that
        are stored on the server).

(JCM)   altered ARError() so that return codes of OK or WARNING don't
        signal an error. For example, GetListEntries would return
        nothing if you matched more than the max allowed, now it returns
        the max allowable number of records and places a warning message
        into the error hash.
